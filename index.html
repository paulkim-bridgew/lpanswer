        <p>Answer: it does not matter. It depends on how you read/interpret the fact. 
            But if you decide to read parent(goomba, paragoomba) as 'goomba is parent of paragoomba', it is better to apply the same reading in other similar facts.
            For example, parent(goomba, kinggoomba) --> goomba is parent of kinggoomba, not kinggoomba is parent of goomba.
